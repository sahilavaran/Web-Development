<pre>
    We're talking away
    I don't know what I'm to say
    I'll say it anyway
    Today is another day to find you
    Shyin' away
    Oh, I'll be comin' for your love, okay
    Take on me

    (Take on me)
    Take me on
    (Take on me)
    I'll be gone
    In a day or two
    So needless to say

    I'm odds and ends
    But I'll be stumblin' away
    Slowly learnin' that life is okay
    Say after me
    It's no better to be saf
    e than sorry
    Take on me
    (Take on me)
    Take me on

    (Take on me)
    I'll be gone
    In a day or two
    All the things that you say, yeah
